**Effective date:** February 19, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **True Count: Blackjack Trainer** (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.

## 1) Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide

If you choose to create or use an account, we may collect information associated with the sign-in method you choose:

* **Email address** (if you sign in with email)
* **Account identifiers** from **Google Sign-In** or **Sign in with Apple** (such as a user ID)
* You may also use the App with **anonymous sign-in**, which creates an account identifier without directly identifying you

We do not require you to provide a real name.

### B. Information collected automatically

The App and its third-party services may automatically collect certain information, including:

* **Device information** (device model, OS version, language)
* **App activity** (screens viewed, interactions, basic usage events)
* **Approximate location** may be inferred by ad providers from IP address for ad relevance and fraud prevention (the App does not request precise location permission)
* **Advertising identifiers** (such as the Android Advertising ID) and similar identifiers used for advertising and analytics

### C. Information stored locally on your device

The App stores some data locally to provide features and track progress, such as:

* Training stats, settings, progress, and preferences
* Session history and other in-app performance records

Local data stays on your device unless you choose to sign in and the App provides a feature that syncs certain data online.

## 2) How We Use Information

We use information to:

* Provide and maintain the App’s features
* Enable sign-in and account-related functionality
* Save your progress and preferences
* Show ads and measure ad performance
* Improve stability and performance (for example, troubleshooting crashes and bugs)
* Prevent fraud, abuse, and security issues

The App uses **Google AdMob** to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use information (such as advertising identifiers and device information) to:

* Serve and personalize ads (where allowed)
* Measure ad performance

Depending on the features enabled in your build, Firebase may process:

* App interactions/events
* Crash and performance diagnostics (if enabled)

Firebase Authentication is used to support:

* Anonymous sign-in

We may share information:

* With **service providers** that power the App (for example, Google AdMob and Firebase)
* If required by law or to respond to valid legal requests
* To protect rights, safety, and security (for example, fraud prevention)

## 6) Your Choices and Controls

### A. Advertising controls

You can reset or limit the use of your advertising ID in your device settings:

* Android: Settings → Privacy → Ads (options vary by device/Android version)

### B. Account controls

If you sign in, you can sign out at any time from within the App (if the App provides sign-out controls) or through your provider (Google/Apple).

### C. Local data

You can remove locally stored app data by uninstalling the App or clearing app storage in your device settings.

## 7) Data Retention

* Local data is retained on your device until you delete the App or clear its storage.
* Account-related data (such as authentication identifiers) may be retained as long as your account remains active or as needed to provide the service and comply with legal obligations.

## 8) Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9) Security

We take reasonable steps to protect information, including using encryption in transit where supported by the services we use (such as Google Firebase). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 10) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above and may provide additional notice within the App.
